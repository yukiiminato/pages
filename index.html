            こんにちは、またははこんばんは。<br>
            <br>
            Name's Inder. You should already know that by now.<br>
            Average 17 year old (almost?) who likes to break stuff. Expensive stuff.<br>
            I like to watch anime (romance mostly), listen to a TON of music (J-Pop mostly, sometimes a bunch of random old indian songs) and obviously, gaming.<br>
            I also like cars. Especially old shitboxes. car go brr <br>
            I also like taking a ton of photos. I don't have good hardware, but I mainly depend on my dad's Pixel 8 for it. (I myself had a Pixel 3a but that's gone. rip)<br> 
            I play the keyboard, by the way! I even make some music sometimes. I'm not good at it, but I try. (You can find some in my YT down there)<br>
            <br>
            I plan to be some kind of doctor in the future, but knowing how I am, especially in studies? Maybe not. But I'll try. I'll try my best.<br>
